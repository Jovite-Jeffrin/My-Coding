![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2fb228b-397c-4c35-bfe7-43d2cbfee7ea)

From the above table 
* Find the number of new and repeat customers per day.
* How much they spent

##### Task 01:
By comparing the order_date with the joined_date i.e first transation happend. Joined_date can be found by taking min(order_date) using aggregate function.

```sql
with cte as (
	SELECT
		customer_id, MIN(order_date) as joined_date
	FROM customer_orders
	GROUP BY 1),
cte2 as (
	SELECT 
		co.*, c.joined_date
	FROM customer_orders co 
	JOIN cte c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id)

SELECT
	order_date,
    sum(CASE WHEN order_date = joined_date THEN  1 ELSE 0 end) as new_customer,
    sum(CASE WHEN order_date != joined_date THEN  1 ELSE 0 end)  as old_customer
FROM cte2
GROUP BY 1
order by 1;
```

##### Task 02:
Finding the amount spent

```sql
with cte as (
	SELECT
		customer_id, MIN(order_date) as joined_date
	FROM customer_orders
	GROUP BY 1),
cte2 as (
	SELECT 
		co.*, c.joined_date
	FROM customer_orders co 
	JOIN cte c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id)

SELECT
	order_date,
    sum(CASE WHEN order_date = joined_date THEN  1 ELSE 0 end) as new_customer,
    sum(CASE WHEN order_date != joined_date THEN  1 ELSE 0 end)  as old_customer,
    sum(CASE WHEN order_date = joined_date THEN  order_amount ELSE 0 end) as new_customer_spent,
    sum(CASE WHEN order_date != joined_date THEN  order_amount ELSE 0 end) as new_customer_spent
FROM cte2
GROUP BY 1
order by 1;
